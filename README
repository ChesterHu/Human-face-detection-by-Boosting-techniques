Human face detection by Boosting techniques:

The main part of the project is written in C++ code. I also used Python PIL module to split image
and draw rectangles in pictures. Here is a brif description of code file

1. "get_rec.py": python code for drawing rectangles on human face. need prediction data from
   Boosting.

2. "img2txt.py": python code for transforming "bmp" file into np.array and store in a txt file

3. "ROC.py": python code for drawing ROC curve for Boosting predictions

4. "split.py": python code for split background image into 16*16 size image as "hard-negative" samples

5. "main.cpp": main function for cpp code, also including testing function for human face detection.

6. "load.h": cpp code for data loading, classifier initialization, finding threshold and prediction

7 "global.h": cpp code for global variables: training size, testing size
